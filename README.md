# pokemonModules

To showcase and improve my skills as an advanced frontend developer, i want to create one large continuous project, instead of multiple small ones.

Pokemon is perfect for this, because of the topics extensive data and possible functionalities. For example remaking the battle system using frontend state handling).

"Standalone" Modules can consume assistance modules and can also be deployed. 

It is also possible to import "Standalone" Modules into other "Standalone" Modules, to create larger applications.

For example, the pokedex module will be integrated into any future module in which the user might need information about a Pokemon.

## Monorepo Standalone Modules:

### Blog and Documentation
https://pokemonmodules-blog.netlify.app/

### Pokedex
https://pokemonmodules-pokedex.netlify.app/

## Monorepo Assistance Modules:

### pokemon api
Redux Toolkit Query wrapper for pokeapi.co.

### common components
provides small, reusable react components, e.g. "< PokemonIcon id={number} / >", which takes the id of a pokemon and returns an < img / > tag with its 96x96 px Icon.

### pokemon mui themes
contains Material UI theme overrides based on the colors of Pokemon. Picking the perfect Color Theme is the hardest part of any project, so why not let the professionals do the work. Every Pokemon is designed by an entire team of master designers and most have a clear primary color and a fitting accent color.

## Legacy Modules:
These are older Projects that will soon be refactored and integrated into the monorepo.
