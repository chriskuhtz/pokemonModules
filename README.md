### Battle System: let opponent AI pick random move

## Next Release: 
### Battle System: Status Condition Sleep

## Overview:

To showcase and improve my skills as an advanced frontend developer, i want to create one large continuous project, instead of multiple small ones.

Pokemon is perfect for this, because of the topics extensive data and possible functionalities. For example remaking the battle system using frontend state handling).

"Standalone" Modules can consume support modules and can also be deployed. 

It is also possible to import "Standalone" Modules into other "Standalone" Modules, to create larger applications.

For example, the pokedex module will be integrated into any future module in which the user might need information about a Pokemon.
